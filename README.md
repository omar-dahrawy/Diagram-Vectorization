# Diagram-Vectorization

## Description

The aim of this project is to use deep-learning along with OpenCV to vectorize hand-drawn diagrams. The program uses OpenCV to detect shapes in an image, and then exports these shapes to a deep-learning program that classifies these shapes into geometrical ones. Next, the position, size, and orientation of the shapes is exported and used along with the classified shape to redraw the diagram using vectors.
